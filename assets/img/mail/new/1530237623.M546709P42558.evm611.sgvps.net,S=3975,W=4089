Check this out... I've been running a lot of tests on my website recently to see what I could do to increase leads and sales.  I realized I wasn't using FOMO and I noticed you aren’t either. 

Fear of missing out or FOMO, really gets people to take action. 

I ran a split test to see how effective it would be. One page didn't have Proof on it, the other did. That was the only difference and guess what... The page with Proof got 23% more leads than the one without it!

I thought this tool would help you too. I'm by no means "techy" and I was still able to install it myself pretty quickly, and if you have any trouble their customer success team is AMAZING.

Great website by the way.
